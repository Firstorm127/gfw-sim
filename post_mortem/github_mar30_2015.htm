<p>This describes a new feature of <em>gfw-router</em>: hijacking.</p>

<h2>What happened</h2>

<p>At some point on Mar 27, 2015, it was discovered that an URL to
a Baidu Ad (similar to Google Adsense) script was hijacked to return
a script that repeatedly pulls some repo at <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>.</p>

<p>The hijack was only found targetting some traffic from mostly northern America.</p>

<p>Github mitigated by returning 'alert("malicious script found on this domain")', which blocks the execution of the JavaScript in question before user clicks on 
the prompt.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/yegle">@yegle</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/yegle/status/581315307811180544">his discovery</a>.</p>

<h2>What to simulate</h2>

<p>Hijacking an URL to return a certain script (similar to XSS).</p>

<h2>How to simulate</h2>

<p>HTTP requests to some domains are redirected to the router itself on port 80,
which serves a Javascript file using <code>netcat</code>.</p>

<h2>How do I use it</h2>

<p>Use the latest version of GFWRouter.</p>
